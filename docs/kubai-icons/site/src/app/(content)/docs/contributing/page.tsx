      <div className="my-5 space-y-5">
          <h2>Request an icon</h2>
          <p>Open an <a href={`${REPO}/issues/new?template=icon-request.yml`}>icon request</a> that states what the icon is for, the everyday object that represents it and its hover motion. Requests with a clear object are drawn first.</p>
          <h2>Report an icon bug</h2>
          <p>To report a problem such as visible seams, blurry marks at small sizes or incorrect motion, open an <a href={`${REPO}/issues/new?template=icon-bug.yml`}>icon bug</a> and attach a screenshot.</p>
          <h2 id="submit-an-icon">Submit an icon</h2>
          <p>If you drew an icon with the skill or by hand and do not want to open a pull request, use the <Link href="/icons/submit/">submission page</Link>. It checks your files in the browser and prepares a GitHub issue. Files stay in the browser until you post the issue.</p>
          <p>Export the drawing as SVG. With the skill, run <code>node scripts/export.mjs</code>. A static SVG is enough: if the icon is accepted, the motion is added during review. To propose your own motion, add the icon&apos;s source file.</p>
          <p>A maintainer reviews each submission by eye against the design rules, using a preview posted on the issue. Logos, trademarks and anything traced from another icon set cannot be accepted. Accepted icons join the library under the MIT License, credited to you.</p>
          <p>To have a coding agent submit the icon, paste this prompt into it. The agent asks you to confirm the terms, then posts the issue with the GitHub CLI:</p>
          <Code code={submitPrompt("en")} />
          <h2>Draw an icon</h2>
          <p>Icons are stored in <code>icons/</code>, one ES module per icon. Draw them with the <Link href="/skill/">Kubai Icons skill</Link> or by hand, following <a href={`${REPO}/blob/master/PROMPT.md`}>PROMPT.md</a> and <a href={`${REPO}/blob/master/docs/authoring.md`}>docs/authoring.md</a>. To check your work, replace <code>my-icon</code> below with your icon&apos;s name:</p>
        </div>
      <Code lang="bash" code={`git clone ${REPO}
cd kubai-icons && npm install
node tools/check.mjs --only my-icon --with folder,mail   # contact sheets in check-out/lib
npm run validate                                          # names, metadata, markup
npm run build:packages
npm test`} />
      <div className="my-5 space-y-5">
          <p><code>tools/check.mjs</code> generates contact sheets, which are preview images that show your icon next to the existing icons listed with <code>--with</code>. Attach them to your pull request. CI renders the changed icons again and runs the tests, and a maintainer reviews how well the icon fits the set.</p>
          <h2>License</h2>
          <p>Contributed icons and package code are released under the MIT License. Changes to the website and the skill follow their own terms, listed on the <Link href="/license/">License</Link> page.</p>
        </div>
    </Prose>
